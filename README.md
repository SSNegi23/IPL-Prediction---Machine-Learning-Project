During the IPL season , we all love to watch matches between our favourite teams and predict the score of the team would be scoring in an innings . Our project will assist you in predicting the score of first innings of an IPL match.

It use machine learning algorithm and based on data of previous played IPL match from year 2008-2021 from kaggle dataset to help in predicting score of `TATA IPL 2022` and using Flask we have developed a web app and deployed it using Heroku.
Using web appliacation we can give input for our favourite teams , selecting who would be batting first and give the how many over have been passed along with minimum threshols as 6 overs and number of runs scored and wicket fallen along with the scored and wicket fallen in last 5 overs (to track current performance) and predicting the final score of first inning with comparision of different machine learning models such as `Linear Regression` , `Ridge Regression`, `Random Forest Regression` , `Artificial Neural Network (Multi Layer Perceptron)` .
